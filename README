This is the bare framework of the "bitstarter",
part of "HW#3" assignment (for the Coursera 
Startup Engineering MOOC thingy), but more importantly,
the beginnings of a real useful web app. 

Whoo hoo!

Now, I have never done anything non-trivial with async code
before, but more importantly, I didn't realize restler was
async because, well, I didn't RTFM I guess. However, that 
hit a lot of people on the forumns and it could have been
made more obvious.

Nonetheless, I finished my working version of the grader.js
before I hit the forumns, so I figured it out all by myself,
yah me. 

Async stuff is a skill I need to get better at so I will work
diligently on it. It is not 'fun' yet but I get the impression
that it will become so. At the very least, it will be another,
very valuable skill. 


>>> Some totally irrelevant ranting:

I think I'm supposed to make a reference to some 
sorta game, like maybe complaining that hunting a 
Tomato for three hours is not my idea of "fun" and
I have no idea what Square was thinking with 
Final Fantasy 12, but moreso, what human masses
were thinking by not only buying it, but freaking
well enduring it and claiming is gameplay. Then
apparently giving Sadie death threats when she 
dared to speak the truth? Lame, "gamers", lame. 

Chrono Trigger is fun... Final Fantasy games after six,
well, I've yet to be convinced that there is any
merit to any of them. "Interactive movie" is not always
a good idea. Interactive world, sure. Give meaningful
choices and the illusion of the player being in 
control, not "just press X". 

Okay, that ends my irrelevant rant. I'll go back to
doing JavaScript / node.js stuff now.
