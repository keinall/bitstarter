Maybe what I should have been doing, 
is keeping a "plan" file.

Anyhow, the latest index.html still looks rough,
because really, I don't have a startup idea that 
I would like to do on my own. Running a small business
is hard, startups are harder, and for my sanity (if I still
have any left), I would not try that alone, again.

You're never alone anyhow, context makes all the difference.

Anyhow, enjoying the technical aspects of the course, 
and hopefully I will find time to do some custom graphics
and so forth: even if this is not going to be an actual business,
it should still look like it, right?
